# Electron Svelte Timer

This is a pretty simple stopwatch timer app for me to play around with using Electron and Svelte.

## Developing

Clone the repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`. An Electron window should pop up with the timer.

## Installing

If you want to install the app locally, you can clone the repo, then run `npm install`, then `npm run make`. This will generate a package that you can add to your Applications and run.
